## **Features**

### **Jenkins Pipeline to deploy on AWS EC2**

- Deploy Java Maven App via Jenkins Pipeline on EC2 Instance**

   - Installed SSH agent plugin on Jenkins.
   - Created ssh credentials type for EC2 on Jenkins.
   - Configured Jenkinsfile to use the sshAgent and execute docker run command on EC2.
   - Docker Login to DockerHub or your other private Docker Repository (if you havenâ€™t already).
   - Security Group configured: Added Jenkins IP Address and opened port to access Web App from Browser.
   - Deploy Webapp on EC2 Instance by executed Multi-Branch Pipeline.
   - Access Application on port 3080 in the browser

   - Configured Jenkinsfile to build and deploy on EC2 Instance
   - Executed Multi-Branch Pipeline on Jenkins
   - Try to deploy an App with docker-compose and run a shell script


### **Deploy using Docker Compose (Docker-Compose, ECR)**
- Deploy Java Maven App via Jenkins Pipeline on EC2 Instance using Docker-Compose File
   - Installed Docker-Compose on EC2 Instance
   - Created docker-compose.yaml file
   - Configured Jenkinsfile to execute docker-compose command
   - Executed Jenkins Pipeline and deploy to AWS EC2 Instance
   - Improvement: Extract to Shell Script

### **Complete Pipeline (Docker-Compose, ECR, Dynamic versioning)**
